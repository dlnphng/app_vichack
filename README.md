# UNIN

**Overview**

UniN is a mobile application designed to centralize and streamline campus event management for students. The app aggregates event information from various university clubs and organizations, categorizes these events by faculty, and provides real-time updates, ensuring students have seamless access to relevant opportunities. The goal is to enhance student engagement by simplifying event discovery and fostering a stronger campus community.

**Inspiration**

The idea for UniN was born out of the frustration many students experience when trying to stay informed about campus events. Current solutions, such as individual club pages on social media platforms, are fragmented and often lead to missed opportunities. UniN addresses this problem by providing a unified platform that offers a comprehensive view of all campus events, tailored to the userâ€™s academic and personal interests.
